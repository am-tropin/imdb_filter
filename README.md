# imdb_filter

This code is to filter movie database from IMDb (https://datasets.imdbws.com/). The following options of filtering are available: 
- by lists of favourite and undesirable genres
- by list of tags in titles
- by minimal rating and number of votes
- by date range
- by runtime range
- by lists of categories (actor, actress, director, composer, producer, writer) with option any/all in each category

Unfortunately, the original databases contains a truncated information about titles-personalities connections, so search by set of actors can be uncomplete.
